# **Network Workshop – Collective Exploration**

Ouvroir invites you to a workshop dedicated to exploring network analysis tools in art history and museology. This collaborative session will introduce projects that use these approaches and provide an opportunity to experiment with **Gephi**, a network analysis and visualization tool. Whether you're a beginner or already familiar with the software, this workshop will be a space to test the tool, discuss its applications, and collectively explore its potential.

  Talitha Motter holds a PhD in Art History from the Université de Montréal. Her research focuses on contemporary art networks formed through digital art journals in Brazil, particularly by analyzing art criticism published in these journals (FRQSC,  https://resensibles.hypotheses.org/ and http://www.reseaux-sensibles.art/)). Passionate about the dissemination of art in all its forms, she co-founded the collaborative art journal [Arte ConTexto](https://artcontexto.com.br/) and has carried out various exhibition projects.
