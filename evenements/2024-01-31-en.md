# Progrès dans l'accessibilité du patrimoine culturel par le son : Expériences de réalité augmentée sonore avec la technologie de conduction osseuse

Join us on January 31, 2024, at Ouvroir from 11:30 am to 1:00 pm for the first Midi-Causerie, featuring Andrea Gozzi, a postdoctoral researcher in research-creation (UdeM) who will discuss his work and experimentations at the intersection of Digital Humanities, museology, and studies on perception and music.

## Presentation Summary

Sounds and soundscapes have a profound impact on our daily lives, shaping our activities and memories. Due to its evocative, ephemeral, and intangible nature, sound has the power to evoke the past and enrich the present. Auditory experiences can provide seamless access to cultural and artistic heritage through sound augmented reality (SAR) projects, using bone conduction headphones (BCH). BCH allows the harmonious merging of layers of real and virtual sound, enhancing the realism of virtual sound objects. This interdisciplinary research in digital humanities — combining cultural heritage, sound studies, archaeoacoustics, and museum studies — introduces the history and bone conduction devices to explore the latest SAR experiences with BCH. Use cases of completed projects for museums and theaters in Italy are presented, developed by Mezzo Forte, a company specializing in AR and VR. Examples include sound design and audio guides for Palazzo Vecchio and Museo degli Innocenti (Florence), Fondazione Primo Conti, Roman Theater, and archaeological area (Fiesole), Rocca Malatestiana (Verucchio); augmented and geolocated audio guides for the Parco delle Biancane of UNESCO (Monterotondo Marittimo); musical composition and audio guides for the historical waterways of Livorno; virtual acoustics for the Teatro del Maggio Musicale Fiorentino (Florence); and an interactive SAR theater piece, SOS Ghost, for the Ex ILVA area in Follonica.
