# History of Architecture and Digital Technology: Dialogue or Confrontation?

The next brown-bag lunch of the Ouvroir for Digital Art History and Museology will take place on Tuesday, February 18, 2025, from 11:30 AM to 12:30 PM.

Paul Guhennec will honor us with a presentation of his research, followed by a discussion with Emmanuel Château-Dutier and the audience.

## Paul Guhennec

A postdoctoral researcher at the [Digital Humanities Laboratory of the École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/dhlab/) (Switzerland), his research focuses on the use of new computational methods for architectural history and their epistemological implications. He recently completed his doctoral dissertation on the urban history of Venice, particularly its vernacular domestic architecture.
