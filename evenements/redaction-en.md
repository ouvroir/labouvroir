# Afternoon Writing Sessions at the Ouvroir

We offer you **friendly afternoon writing sessions** at the Ouvroir, every Tuesday from 09:00 AM to 12:00 PM. These sessions, organized around the **Pomodoro technique**, aim to promote focus and productivity through an alternation of work periods and regular breaks.

**Why participate?**
Whether you are a **student, researcher, or professor** in art history or other fields, these sessions offer a collaborative space where you can advance your academic projects, whether it’s a thesis, dissertation, article, or more.

**What is the Pomodoro method?**
Created by Francesco Cirillo in the 1980s, the Pomodoro technique has gained popularity in academic circles. We propose the structure of working for 50 minutes, followed by a 10-minute break. This method helps to:

- Manage distractions and foster concentration,
- Reduce mental and physical fatigue with regular breaks,
- Improve planning and evaluation of completed work,
- Maintain motivation by completing "pomodoros" (work intervals).

**The added value of group Pomodoro sessions:**
In a group setting, the Pomodoro method allows you to:

- Set aside dedicated time for writing projects in a stimulating, collective environment,
- Delegate time management to a session leader, allowing you to fully focus on the task,
- Follow the group’s rhythm and benefit from shared motivation,
- Plan writing objectives more realistically using the SMART approach.

**What does a session look like?**
Our sessions take place in a **bright room** on the 8th floor, with large windows and an atmosphere conducive to concentration. 

**L’Ouvroir**, in collaboration with **Aesthesis**, **CIECO** and **CRIHN**, offers these dedicated writing moments to foster **productive and shared writing**.

Come and join us, enjoy a coffee or tea, and make progress on your projects in a dynamic and supportive atmosphere!

Time: **From 09:00 AM to 12:00 PM**
