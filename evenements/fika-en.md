# The next Fika is coming up fast!!

Feeling like a break? The Ouvroir warmly welcomes you to its Fika! The Ouvroir Fika is a friendly gathering where you can come and chat with members of the lab.

Every Tuesday, the lab organizes a coffee and pastry break for socializing from 4:30 PM to 5:30 PM in room C-8132. Fika is a Swedish tradition designed to bring a community together in a warm and friendly atmosphere to facilitate meetings and discussions.

These gatherings with the team are open to everyone. Come meet or reconnect with the lab.
