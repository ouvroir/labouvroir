## Recurring Events and Initiatives

The Ouvroir continued to offer recurring events such as lab meetings, monthly fikas, regular newsletters, and weekly digital clinics. These events are essential for maintaining cohesion and productivity within the lab, by fostering informal exchanges and in-depth academic discussions. The Ouvroir members' meetings were held on Tuesdays from 11:30 to 12:30.

The lab proposed a new activity in the form of weekly writing afternoons every Tuesday afternoon.

## Organization

The FCI funding has come to an end, the budget has been spent almost entirely. The contracts with external service providers have been established, the server at calcul Québec has been ordered.

William Diakité's contract has come to an end with the end of the FCI funding. Since November 1st, he has been the IT advisor of the CRIHN. His role is now mainly dedicated to supporting the researchers who are members of the center on the digital dimension of their projects as well as developing software solutions to support members and the dh community. Zoë Renaudie is still in the position of laboratory manager but will work fewer hours.
