# Ouvroir members at UQAR symposium

Co-organized by the CRIHN and the Nouvelle-France numérique team, a research partnership that aims to provide lasting solutions to the challenges raised by the digital shift, the study day “Le patrimoine archivistique face au virage numérique : enjeux et avenues pour la recherche partenariale” will be held on September 20, 2024 at the Université du Québec à Rimouski.

## Presentation

This study day will bring together researchers in digital humanity, specialists in artificial intelligence, representatives of archives, libraries and museums, as well as the non-academic public. The aim is to take stock of research into the management of documentary heritage in the context of the digital shift and the development of artificial intelligence. We also aim to identify the technological development needs of institutions involved in the preservation of documentary heritage (archives, museums, libraries), in order to better align research in digital humanity with these needs.

Emmanuel Château-Dutier, scientific director of the Ouvroir, will present his research on _Research data management: a virtuous circle for historical research and heritage institutions_; Alix Chagué, a doctoral student and member of the laboratory, will present _McCATMuS: feedback on the production of a multilingual, multi-secular meta-dataset._.
