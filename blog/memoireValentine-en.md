# Congratulations to Valentine Desmorat on earning her master’s degree!

Valentine Desmorat, a brilliant and passionate student from the L’Ouvroir laboratory, has recently successfully completed her master’s degree. This achievement marks a significant milestone in her academic and professional journey.

Valentine defended her thesis titled [_The Entry of Women Artists into the MAC Collection from 1964 to the Present: Statistical Analyses and Determining Factors_](https://papyrus.bib.umontreal.ca/xmlui/handle/1866/33193), under the direction of Johanne Lamoureux, with a flair that impressed both her peers and mentors. This thesis is a valuable contribution to understanding the mechanisms of recognizing women artists within museum institutions, and we are proud of Valentine for her dedication, rigor, and insight.

Throughout her master’s program, Valentine distinguished herself through her critical thinking, enthusiasm, and ability to collaborate effectively within our laboratory. Her thesis, which aligns with our research projects, has made significant contributions to the use of digital humanities in art history, and we look forward to seeing the impact her discoveries will have in the coming years.

We extend our sincerest congratulations to Valentine for this remarkable achievement. Her success is a reflection of her hard work, determination, and passion for research. We are confident that this milestone is just the beginning of a brilliant and promising career.

Congratulations, Valentine! We wish you all the best for your future endeavors and look forward to seeing all that you will accomplish in the future.
