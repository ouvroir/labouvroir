The Winter 2025 term was marked by a balanced program combining academic discussions, collaborative activities, and convivial gatherings. Below is the full schedule of organized events:

- **January 21**: Ouvroir Kick-off Meeting
- **January 30**: Discussion – *Art History Training and Curricula*
- **February 4**: Lab Meeting

- **February 18**: Lunch Talk with Paul Guehnnec
- **March 18**: Lab Meeting
- **March 27**: Discussion – *Art History Training and Curricula* (2nd Edition)
- **April 17**: Network Workshop

These events fostered rich exchanges on research practices, strengthened connections among members, and opened up interdisciplinary discussions.

## Recurring Events and Initiatives

The Ouvroir continued its regular initiatives, which structure the laboratory’s daily life:

- **Weekly meetings** every Tuesday from 11:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m., essential for coordinating ongoing projects and sharing progress.
- **Monthly fikas**, convivial gatherings encouraging informal discussions among members.
- **Regular newsletters**, ensuring smooth communication and information flow.
- **Weekly digital clinics**, much appreciated for the technical and methodological support they provide.
- **Collective writing afternoons** every Tuesday, bringing together doctoral students and professors in a studious yet relaxed atmosphere. This highly effective and enjoyable initiative will continue in the spring.

## Organization

The term’s schedule was **intentionally lighter**, allowing **members more time for their individual research projects**. This choice follows a reduction in hours for the lab coordinator and responds to a shared desire to better balance time for production and exchange.

## Lab Projects

The Ouvroir’s main projects made significant progress this term:

- **Reframe**: the project is well advanced and nearing completion.
- **Display**: production of the application has begun.
- **Common**: the project remains on hold for now.
- **Infrastructure**: server installation is underway, which will eventually enable better data and project management within the lab.
- **Monitoring**: a discussion on how to share our monitoring work is ongoing.
