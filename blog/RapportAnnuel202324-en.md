## Key Events and Activities

### Fall 2023

Fall 2023 was marked by several enriching events, including a series of lunchtime talks covering topics ranging from surveillance in art to the Omeka platform. A highlight was the major conference and CIÉCO Study Day held in November, showcasing innovative research within the partnership led by Johanne Lamoureux. The lab also received its furniture to welcome students and researchers.

### Winter 2024

At the beginning of 2024, Emmanuel Château-Dutier was in residence in France, and Kristine Tanton was on sabbatical to write two new books. The lab maintained a dynamic schedule with regular meetings, workshops on sound augmented reality, and presentations at conferences in Rennes and Ottawa. Active participation in events like CRIHN further enhanced the visibility and impact of the Ouvroir in the academic community.

### Spring 2024

Spring was a period of consolidation and preparation for upcoming projects. Activities included numerous lab meetings to launch the four [digital tool projects](https://ouvroir.umontreal.ca/projets) in production. We also hosted presentations on ontologies and lunchtime talks highlighting experts like Benoit Deshayes.

### Summer 2024

During the summer, the Ouvroir maintained a steady pace of work despite occasional absences for presentations at external events such as the CSDH Congress in Ottawa, DHNB in Reykjavik, and DH in Washington. Meetings with doctoral students stimulated collaboration and idea exchange before the summer vacation period. The lab staff began producing projects and preparing for the next year.
