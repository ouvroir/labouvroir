# Rencontre hebdomadaire


## Organisation du travail 

### Righettino

Kenan : work with Emmanuel on different operations + start Figma
how to have access to Figma project? 

need animation between going from one region to the other

content organization:
- various level of presentation (depending on link between items) 
- links and multi-item composition

notice : refer to descreption of text

layers: full image / detail / textual (?)

- avoid isolating the elements from the context, favor (constantly) a full page image → work on interaction, brightness/color
- always keep the possibility to explore the image freely
- keep outline on the side?


Content:
- xml:tei
- conversion to html : which structure of file would be required? 

sections or div:
- header for metadata? 
- notice
- transcription
- translation
- reference to edition
- reference to elements of the image

Kenan: demo data
- experiment with real content for test implementation
- prepare sample data

William: working with ajax
- load html content asynchronously
- no manifest for now? it would be very time consuming so might not be the first priority
- how to display data from the html files provided by Kenan

Chaitanya:
- what would be easy or difficult to do based on the v1 figma by Kenan
- implementing sample data and scenario provided by Kenan

Autodesk AutoCAD + sketchup for elevation
for rendering: require enscape but need a license

twinmotion (educational licence)
- allows to add weather, landscape, topography & terrain

- people to scale

issues that the page was deformed by the scanning 
correction layer created geometric issues
hard work to refine the lines and redraw the map
