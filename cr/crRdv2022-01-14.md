# CR réunion Nuria Rodrigez Ortega

## Project presentations Nuria

Macro-project: data analysis and visualisation about exhibition ecosystems in Spain
- Current research serves creative industries. 
- Use knowledge to create value for arts sector and cultural management (develop new policies and stategies)
- Produce new cultural .. evaluate activity in cultural exhibitions
Developping a semantic model: OWL RDF LOD ontology to represent the exhibition ecosystem

## CIECO
New uses of art collections, CRSH grant, 7 year partnership
Digital infrastructure grant: ouvroir

Document historical exhibitions of collection: building a tool for that. Idea is to work on the documentation of collection display as exhbition. Build a documentation model, probably semantic. Also document display in itself, position of paintings in the rooms. Issue with incomplete / partial documentation. Formalize the known information with a semantic documentation model and use it to produce hypotheses that reconstitute exhibition. 
What kind of documentation are we using? Archival collections in museums: exhibitions views, maps, correspondence, artwork list... 
Use CIDOC, Collaborating with canadian heritage information network (RCIP): semantic model (DOPEDA) working group

Interested in the semantic model because their team is at the beggining. But want to publish it before the end of the year.
Cover Actors, Institutions, etc. but not the documentation about the exhibitions.
How to give new access to collections? expertimenting with computer vision, very experimental projects. How to advance and add interactions between institutions, public and collectivities. Computer vision can open new ways to understand the visual imaginary. How can we embody virtual spaces and immersive (abstract/instellectual) installations? 

## Collaboration

Explore how to collaborate on these two lines.
See with her research team and what collaborations can be established/formalize. Perhaps wait until we finish translating our website.
- share references / bibliography
- Working group for the model: see how to open it and collaborate. How we can connect our semantic models

Questions sur le labo
2 main dimensions
1. **research lab**: national and international reasearch. Macro-project about exhibitions. Multiples points of view: semantic model, data analysis (exhibition domain as complex cultural system), mathematic model to analyse value production (measure capacity of museums to dynamise the exhibition process and artwork circulation), 3D reconstruction (not just as a fac-simile, use it as a critical tool to rethink central concepts of the art historical domain such as the similary principle, n-dimensionnal spaces and how they change how cultural objects exhist) and immersive reality, use of machine learning and computer vision to build new curatorial projects (generative curatorial projects, build new narratives with AI. How to go beyond the concept of similarity, for example use contradiction...). 
2. **formative**: courses, seminars and summer schools. Train historians and add critical thinking.

## Events
This year: Speak at our brown-bag lunches

Next year: Have more seminars with the DAH community to share our research. Plan something in this direction for the next year. Make a cartography of the labs and research groups. How to make the event: ~one session per month next year? Associate with Harald Klinke (DAH Journal), Anne Helmreich (Getty)?

Repository of DAH (Emmanuel). Malaga has a spanish-speaking repository, planned to publish next june. Something to bring in a global.

Mid-april/mai: more developped model. Have a collaborative session to share?

>The purpose of the project is to study and interpret the art exhibition domain as an instance of the cultural complex systems.  We will circumscribe to the Spanish domain taken as specific study case. Our intention is to combine network analysis and NLP methodologies since we will incorporate a linguistic corpus associated to art exhibitions (such as catalogue and art criticism texts) to the art exhibition metadata in order to produce a multidimensional knowledge. Data will be published as LOD taking as reference an ontology that we are building in the context of other project that we are developing right now.
