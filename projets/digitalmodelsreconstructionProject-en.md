The Digital Models Reconstruction project is an external relational database that is linked to the digital model in its native software through a unique identifier. The structure of the project database allows users to document the evidence and hypotheses of aa digital reconstruction, essentially providing a way to annotate (or footnote) a 3D digital model so that the model is accessible to other researchers after its initial creation.
