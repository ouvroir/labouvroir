# Digital Models Reconstruction project

The Digital Models Reconstruction project is an external relational database, which links 3D reconstruction model

The Digital Models Reconstruction project is an external relational database that is linked to the digital model in its native software through a unique identifier. The structure of the project database allows users to document the evidence and hypotheses of aa digital reconstruction, essentially providing a way to annotate (or footnote) a 3D digital model so that the model is accessible to other researchers after its initial creation.
