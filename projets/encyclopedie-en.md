# Editorial model of the Digital Encylopedia of New Uses of Art Collections

This project is dedicated to the work on the editorial model of the Digital Encylopedia of New Uses of Art Collections. This will be based on the use of the Text Encoding Initiative (an international XML standard for scientific publishing that will serve as a pivotal format). These developments will be carried out internally by the person in charge of developing the infrastructure under the direction of Emmanuel Château-Dutier, a specialist in XML technologies.

1. the definition of a documentary model expressed in the ODD language for the creation of RelaxNG schemas and the creation of a complex editorial model to handle the various multimedia contents (hypertextual structures, chronologies, lists, videos, illustrations)
2. Customization of XSL TEI Stylesheets for the conversion of authors' manuscripts into this editorial model

\*_The editorial model is designed by the laboratory in the framework of the Partnership [New uses of collections in art museums](https://www.cieco.co). Project manager: Lena Krause. Scientific director: Emmanuel Chateau-Dutier._
