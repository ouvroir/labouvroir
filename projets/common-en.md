# Common

The Common databse (DB) is intended to collect, describe with appropriate metadata all the sources mobilized and the documentary contents produced within the framework of the partnership (redeployment of collections (axis 1), citizen archives (axis 2), processing of acquisition files and institutional policies (axis 3 and 4), and to collect visual and audiovisual sources for the preparation of the _Encyclopedia_). It is a multi-user document management system that allows the archiving, reporting and sharing of documentation through user-friendly interfaces and serves as a collaborative work platform for all researchers and research assistants involved in the project.

The database will be produced by an external provider specialized in library applications using the free and open source content manager Omeka-S which offers the necessary functionalities for the description of cultural resources with business metadata (Dublin Core qualified, BIBO, LIDO, BIO-CRM) and allows the use of structured vocabularies in SKOS format. Omeka-S allows to feed an OAI-PMH repository to search engines specialized in humanities and a programmable interface (API REST) to connect resources with the Encyclopedia.

\*_Common is designed by the laboratory in the framework of the Partnership [New uses of collections in art museums](https://www.cieco.co). Project manager: Lena Krause. Scientific director: Emmanuel Chateau-Dutier._
