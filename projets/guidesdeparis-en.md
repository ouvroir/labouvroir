# Paris Guidebooks, XVII and XVIIIth century corpus

<!-- project description -->

Paris guidebooks are among the essential sources for the history of buildings and artistic production in Paris in the 17th and 18th centuries, a period that saw publications on the capital and its environs grow exponentially, and evolve in their ambitions, formats and target audiences, from Henri Sauval’s sum of erudition to small guides for foreign travelers.

Their consultation is essential, both to find out what of old Paris has disappeared (palaces, private mansions, churches, convents, etc.) and to criticize the state of what has been preserved. However, these guides remain poorly used or under-exploited, due to the sheer number of volumes and editions, which are materially unwieldy. It is hardly possible for a single researcher to systematically consult all the editions of a given object (a building, painting, sculpture, decoration, etc.) – Gilles Chabaud estimates that there are around 300 for the period in question), even though the information published may differ.

The project is based on the XML-TEI encoding of four major texts on ancient Paris and its monuments, published between the end of the 17th century and the first half of the 18th century: Henri Sauval, _Histoire et recherches des antiquités de la ville de Paris_, 3 volumes, Paris, 1724; Germain Brice, _Description nouvelle de ce qu’il y a de plus remarquable dans la ville de Paris_, 2 volumes, Paris, 1684; Lemaire, _Paris ancien et nouveau_, 3 volumes, Paris, 1685 and Piganiol de La Force, _Description de Paris, de Versailles, de Marly, de Meudon_, 8 volumes, Paris, 1742. The publication of these texts on the web aims to facilitate consultation of these « Paris guidebooks », major sources for the history of the arts in modern France. Since the beginning of the project, a good number of Paris guides have been digitized by partner BnF. Given the inadequacy of digitization for this type of document and the nature of the queries to which researchers submit them, a TEI edition, usually reserved for complex texts, was chosen to allow traditional queries (full-text searches), but also to build reference indexes on Paris (indexes of places, monuments/works, names of artists, commissioners etc.). All content is made available under a free license via a programmable interface used to publish the site, enabling it to be reused in other applications. The web consultation application is hosted by TGIR Huma-num.

The website [Guides de Paris](https://www.guidesdeparis.fr) brings together the results of the project Guides de Paris, Les historiens d’art et les corpus numériques conducted under the direction of _Marianne Cojannot-Le Blanc_ within the [Labex les Passés dans le présent](http://passes-present.eu/). This work was supported by a grant from the French government managed by the Agence nationale de la recherche under the Investissements d’avenir program, reference [ANR-11-LABX-0026-01](https://anr.fr/ProjetIA-11-LABX-0026).
