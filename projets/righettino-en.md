# Righettino

<!-- Project Description -->

[Righettino](https://ouvroir.github.io/righettino/) is a prototype application developed within the Digital Art History and Museology Workshop. It builds upon the research work of Professor [Denis Ribouillaut](https://histart.umontreal.ca/repertoire-departement/professeur/in/in19365/sg/Denis%20Ribouillault/) (University of Montreal) on the theologian and amateur draftsman Girolamo Righettino.

The latter is known for his drawings of Italian cities featuring richly adorned allegorical frames created in the late 16th century. His only surviving work is a view of Turin, dated 1583, currently preserved in the National Archives of Turin. This intricately detailed and extraordinarily complex piece, in terms of allegorical program, is practically impossible to publish within the traditional book format without losing much of its allure. This project, involving the digital publication of the drawing and the <!--manuscript written by Righettino--> explanation of its meaning, provides an opportunity to consider how digital publication in art history can facilitate better readings of Renaissance images, especially those with diagrammatic structures and that play on the combination of various modes of representation.

Within the broader framework of the research partnership [CIÉCO](http://cieco.umontreal.ca/) "New Uses of Collections in Art Museums," supported by the Workshop, this issue of reading and interpretation operations forms a use case to evaluate technologies related to the [IIIF (International Image Interoperability Framework)](https://iiif.io/) protocol and its [ecosystem](https://github.com/IIIF/awesome-iiif).

This case study involved testing several virtual exhibition tools ([exhibit](https://www.exhibit.so/), [storiiies](http://storiiies.cogapp.com/), [juncture](https://juncture-digital.org/)), currently available web development tools (especially [OpenSeaDragon](https://openseadragon.github.io/) and [Canvas Panel](https://iiif-canvas-panel.netlify.app/)), as well as a IIIF image management and dissemination tool ([Cantaloupe](https://cantaloupe-project.github.io/)). The experiments conducted with these tools are described in the [Ouvroir IIIF repository](https://github.com/ouvroir/IIIF/tree/main/documentation).
