We are located on the 8ᵗʰ floor of Lionel-Groulx Pavilion (Université de Montréal, 3150 rue Jean-Brillant, Montréal H3T 1N8). The lab space  is shared with the Centre de recherche interuniversitaire sur les  humanités numériques ([CRIHN](https://www.crihn.org)). The lab space comprises:

- a collaborative workroom and conference room (C-8132, 12 seats)
- multiple workstations for individual research or small groups (C-8132 and C-8134, 6 seats)
- two 3D and multimedia creation stations (C-8134)
- an office for the lab manager, and the CIÉCO and CRIHN coordinators (C-8130)

## Meet ups

### Fika

Every week, the lab organizes a coffee break (with pastries) to meet and socialize on **first Wednesdays of every month, from 3:30 to 4:30pm** at C-8132. [Fika](https://www.swedishfood.com/fika/) is a Swedish tradition, which brings people together in a warm and  welcoming atmosphere. It provides the perfect setting to share ideas and discuss projects.

Team meetings are open to all. Come to meet the team and to chat about your projects!

### Digital clinic

Open **Mondays from 4 to 5 pm**, the clinic aims to supply specialized support for digital art history and musum studies research:

- demonstration of existing digital projects
- research and exploration of datasets
- programming boost and debuging sessions
- gain familiarization with tools such as: Zotero (specifically for  images and artworks), Markdown (for notetaking), and git and github

The clinic takes place in hybrid mode at the office (C-8130), and [online](https://umontreal.zoom.us/j/82480661654?pwd=cUlzb09hZ3lkd2UvcmpPbTdmQkZBQT09) on demand.
