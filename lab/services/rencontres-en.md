### Fika

Every week, the lab organizes a coffee and pastry break for everyone to meet and socialize, **Tuesdays from 4:30 PM to 5:30 PM**, in C-8132. Fika is a [Swedish tradition](https://www.swedishfood.com/fika) designed to bring a community together in a warm and friendly atmosphere to facilitate meetings and discussions.

These meetings with the team are open to everyone. Come meet or reconnect with the lab team and discuss your projects!
