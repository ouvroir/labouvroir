Talitha Motter obtained her PhD in Art History at Université de Montréal, under the supervision of Professor Emmanuel Château-Dutier and the co-supervision of Professor Christine Bernier. Her research ["Responsive networks: a study of online art magazines in Brazil"](https://resensibles.hypotheses.org/) (FRQSC) seeks to understand what happens to art magazines in the digital regime, highlighting their connection to the present moment based on the analysis of art reviews. Since 2013, she has participated in many projects that intended to promote the debate on contemporary art, such as co-editor of the independent online magazine [Arte ConTexto](https://artcontexto.com.br/).
