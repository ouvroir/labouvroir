My areas of expertise are sculpture, architecture, and history from 1000 to 1300. My research focuses on two principal areas: the dynamic relationship among sculpture, epigraphy, architecture, and ritual activity in the Middle Ages, and the material processes in medieval art and architecture, specifically through 3D reconstructions of medieval monuments. I employ new media and information technology coupled with traditional research methods to perform qualitative and quantitative analysis. I am particularly interestd in how technology can allow for the development of a scientific argument, as well as the expansion and scaling of research.
