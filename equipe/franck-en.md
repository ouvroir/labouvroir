Franck Calard is a PhD candidate in art history at the Université de Montréal, under the supervision of Louise Vigneault and Emmanuel Château-Dutier. Specializing in the history of Quebec and Canadian stained glass, his research more broadly examines cultural transfers, the circulation of glassmaking expertise, and the processes through which religious heritage has been documented, interpreted, and preserved in Quebec from the nineteenth to the twenty-first century. He holds several degrees in art history (Sorbonne Université), visual arts (Université Paris 1 – Panthéon-Sorbonne), heritage and local development (Université du Mans), modern literature (Sorbonne Nouvelle), and religious studies (Université d’Artois). His work adopts an interdisciplinary approach at the intersection of art history, heritage studies, and cultural studies. As a consultant for the Conseil du patrimoine religieux du Québec (CPRQ), he contributes to the analysis, documentation, and valorization of religious movable property and works of art. He is also a student member of the Centre de recherche interuniversitaire sur la littérature et la culture au Québec (CRILCQ) and a member of the Réseau de recherches interdisciplinaires sur les interactions entre cultures, langues et apprentissages scolaires (RIICLAS).
