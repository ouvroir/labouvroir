## Information and anthology of projects

### DH Now

>*Digital Humanities Now* is an experimental, edited publication that highlights and distributes informally published digital humanities scholarship and resources from the open web. Since 2009, *DHNow* has been refining processes of aggregation, discovery, curation, and review to open and extend conversations about the digital humanities research and practice.

https://digitalhumanitiesnow.org

### dahProjects

> The aim of this directory is to comprehensively document projects in digital art history on an international scale since the advent of the world wide web. It focuses on research that mobilizes digital art-historical methodologies through web-based research and the compilation of bibliographic sources. It should be stressed from the outset that its current scope is limited to projects that have a showcase on the web. Projects involving the dissemination of digitized museum collections or digital mediation have not been included.

https://github.com/ouvroir/dahprojects

### Digital Art History Directory

>The Digital Art History Directory (DAHD) is an open-access publication containing a database of digital art history projects and information on data sources, best practices in Digital Art History project construction, preservation, and web archiving. Intended to be the largest, most comprehensive, and inclusive collection of information on Digital Art History and to function as a tool and living resource, rather than a static publication, the DAHD provides a platform for discovery, sharing, and research of Digital Art History.

https://dahd.hcommons.org

### DH Awards

> **Digital Humanities Awards** are a set of annual awards where the public is able to nominate resources for the recognition of talent and expertise in the digital humanities community. The resources are nominated and voted for entirely by the public. The weeding out by the nominations committee is solely based on the criteria of “Is it DH?”, “Is it in the right category?”, and “Was it launched/published/majorly updated in that year?”. These awards are intended as an awareness raising activity, to help put interesting DH resources in the spotlight and engage DH users (and general public) in the work of the community. Awards are not specific to geography, language, conference, organization or field of humanities that they benefit. Any suitable resource in any language or writing system may be nominated in any category. DH Awards actively encourages representation from more minority languages, cultures, and areas of DH. All nominated resources are worth investigating to see the range of DH work out there.

http://www.humanisti.ca

#### Société canadienne des Humanités numériques

> La [Société canadienne des Humanités numériques/Canadian Society of Digital Humanities](http://csdh-schn.org) a d’abord été connue sous le nom de Consortium pour ordinateurs en sciences humaines / Consortium for Computers in the Humanities (COSH/COCH), fondé en 1986 pour regrouper des représentants des collèges et universités canadiennes. Notre objectif est de rassembler les collègues engagés dans des activités d’enseignement, de recherche et de création en liaison avec des ressources numériques. Notre association encourage les travaux dans les deux langues officielles du Canada. Elle vise à renforcer les interactions entre les communautés anglophone et francophone dans tous les domaines, au plan des publications et des travaux en collaboration, en appuyant des événements d’envergure nationale et internationale et en jouant un rôle de conseil auprès des instances subventionnaires.

http://csdh-schn.org

> [The Alliance of Digital Humanities Organizations (ADHO)](https://adho.org) promotes and supports digital research and teaching across all arts and humanities disciplines, acting as a community-based advisory force, and supporting excellence in research, publication, collaboration and training.

https://adho.org

### Initiatives d’intérêt

#### Digital Medievalist

> [Digital Medievalist](https://digitalmedievalist.wordpress.com) is an international web-based community for medievalists working with digital media. It was established in 2003 to help scholars meet the increasingly sophisticated demands faced by designers of contemporary digital projects. _Digital Medievalist_ publishes an open access journal, sponsors conference sessions, runs an email discussion list and encourages best practice in digital medieval resource creation.

https://digitalmedievalist.wordpress.com

#### Inke

> Implementing new knowledge environnements
>
> The [INKE Partnership](http://inke.ca) is a collective of researchers and partners who are concerned with networked open social scholarship and the future of scholarly communication in the digital age. Networked open social scholarship involves creating and disseminating research and research technologies to a broad, interdisciplinary audience of specialists and non-specialists in ways that are both accessible and significant. It builds on a foundation of digital scholarship, social knowledge creation, open access, and digital humanities.

http://inke.ca

#### Digital Methods Initiative (DMI)

> The Digital Methods Initiative is a contribution to doing research into the “natively digital”. Consider, for example, the hyperlink, the thread and the tag. Each may ’remediate’ older media forms (reference, telephone chain, book index), and genealogical histories remain useful (Bolter & Grusin, 1999; Elsaesser, 2005; Kittler, 1995). At the same time new media environments - and the software-makers - have implemented these concepts, algorithmically, in ways that may resist familiar thinking as well as methods (Manovich, 2005; Fuller, 2007). In other words, the effort is not simply to import well-known methods - be they from humanities, social science or computing. Rather, the focus is on how methods may change, however slightly or wholesale, owing to the technical specificities of new media.

https://digitalmethods.net

#### Minimal Computing

> We envision this web space as a place for thought pieces on minimal computing, examples and how-to pieces, listings of events and resources, and as a place to find collaborators. Please watch this space for further developments. The GO::DH Minimal Computing Working Group kickstarted itself into life with a workshop on July 8 at the DH2014 conference in Lausanne, Switzerland.

http://go-dh.github.io/mincomp/

#### AVINDH SIG

> ADHO **Special Interest Group AudioVisual Material in Digital Humanities (AVinDH)**. Our SIG AVinDH is meant to be a venue for exchanging knowledge, expertise, methods and tools by scholars who make use of audiovisual data types that can convey a certain level of narrativity: spoken audio, video and/or (moving) images.

https://avindhsig.wordpress.com

#### Linked infrastructure for Networked Cultural Scholarship (LINCS)

> LINCS provides the tools and infrastructure to make humanities data more discoverable, searchable, and shareable. Discover how you can explore, create, and publish cultural data.

https://lincsproject.ca

#### Digging into Data Challenge

> The Digging into Data Challenge aims to address how “big data” changes the research landscape for the humanities and social sciences. Now that we have massive databases of materials available for research in the humanities and the social sciences--ranging from digitized books, newspapers, and music to information generated by Internet-based activities and mobile communications, administrative data from public agencies, and customer databases from private sector organizations-—what new, computationally-based research methods might we apply? As the world becomes increasingly digital, new techniques will be needed to search, analyze, and understand these materials. Digging into Data challenges the research community to help create the new research infrastructure for 21st-century scholarship.

## Centres de recherche et équipes

### Canada

#### Centre de recherche interuniversitaire sur les humanités numériques (CRIHN)

> Depuis sa création à l’automne 2013, le **Centre de recherche interuniversitaire sur les humanités numériques** (CRIHN) fédère les expertises des chercheur·euse·s québécois·e·s en humanités numériques au sein d’une structure qui permet à la fois de valoriser les travaux individuels et de nouer de nouvelles collaborations, tant pour des projets de recherche et des demandes de subvention que pour la direction d’étudiant·e·s de deuxième et troisième cycles, et de stagiaires postdoctorale·aux. Au fil des années, il a réussi à se positionner comme un pôle structurant de premier plan au Québec pour ce champ de recherche et il jouit déjà d’une réelle reconnaissance canadienne et internationale.

http://www.crihn.org

#### The Digital Humanities Initiative (McGill)

> Over the past several decades, advances in computing, data and information management, and archival techniques have greatly altered how humanities scholars approach their objects of study. In particular, over the past five years, the web 2.0 revolution has made these advancements more applicable than ever before to humanities research endeavours. Digital Humanities, however it is defined, can no longer be seen as a particular sub-set of humanistic research as it has become an increasingly integrated element within normative everyday humanities scholarship. Consequently, it includes more than text-encoding or image digitization and the creation of electronic archives. Rather, it is how such electronic media are used and studied by researchers in a wide array of projects from linguistic analyses to the changing realms of new media.
